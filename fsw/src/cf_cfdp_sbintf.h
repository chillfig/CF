/** @brief Obtain a message buffer to construct a PDU inside.

 * @par Description
 *       This performs the handshaking via semaphore with the consumer
 *       of the PDU. If the semaphore can be obtained, a software bus
 *       buffer is obtained and it is returned. If the semaphore is
 *       unavailable, then the current transaction is remembered for next
 *       engine cycle. If silent is true, then the event message is not
 *       printed in the case of no buffer available.
 *
 * @par Assumptions, External Events, and Notes:
 *       t must not be NULL.
 *
 * @param t      Pointer to the transaction object
 * @param silent If true, suppresses error events if no message can be allocated
 *
 * @returns Pointer to a CF_Logical_PduBuffer_t on success.
 * @retval  NULL on error
